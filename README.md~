# RGBD-Vision
Navigation using Algorithms for Stereo Vision

## Description
This is a collection of methods used for our bot at AGV using RGB-D Vision.


## Guidelines
1. Create a proper folder for each algorithm. All ros packages will be inside the ros-packages folder
2. Each folder will contain a readme file containing entire documentation of the algorithm including links for reference, reading materials and all the sources you have used in creating the package.
3. Each individual file(not a ros package) will be in a different folder along with a readme.
